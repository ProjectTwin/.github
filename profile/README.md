1.	Introduction
Assume the reader has very little knowledge of the subject. Introduce the topic, the sector of business/industry concerned and how the project relates to it. Define the context of the problem and identify the research required to solve it.

Digital twins (DT) have arrived in the modern world alongside other innovative technologies as the Industry Revolution 4.0. However, many have not heard of digital twins even in the digital world. Digital twins present itself with a vague definition that goes by a virtual replica of a physical objects, assets, entities, processes, or systems; DT exists to provide a dynamic data-driven representation of their real-world counterparts. 
The value of digital twins comes from the usage of the virtual entities, the usage from this digital counterpart can be extensive, only limited by creativity. But for a brief understanding of this usage, this proposal will categorize it into 5 categories: 
Monitor – monitor the real-world entities via the digital counterpart, examine the environment data, process data, geometry data, etc.
Prediction – predict the performance of the entity such as lifespan, maintenance requirement, production, energy input/output, etc.
Simulation – the powerful feature of DT, visualizing the entities at work; and when combine with prediction usage, allowing tuning of some variable of the DT and simulate the outcome of the DT, such as simulating a design concept, an HVAC system, a production factory, etc.
Diagnosis – diagnose/interrogate the entity by understanding all the elements that go through and happen in the twin, allowing diagnosis of entity such as identifying the bottleneck of a system, understanding the root cause of an accident, knowing the key performer, etc.
Optimization – optimize the real-world system by tuning through the digital world, and also with a proper combination of a few usages of other mentioned categories, the entity can be optimized such as the placement of elements in the system, optimal environment for the system, optimal route in a process, etc.
A digital twin is essentially a digital version of a real-world object, system, or process. For example, a factory's machinery, a city’s infrastructure, or even a human body can all have digital twins. These twins are not just static models; they continuously receive data from sensors and other sources to reflect the current state of their physical counterparts. This connection allows organizations to monitor the real-world entities, predict how they will perform in the future, run simulations to test different scenarios, diagnose problems, and optimize operations.
Project Twin is a community-driven platform designed to make the creation, management, and deployment of digital twins accessible to everyone, especially small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Traditionally, developing digital twins has been a complex and resource-intensive process, often requiring specialized technical expertise. ProjectTwin simplifies this by providing a pre-built digital twin use case that is contributed by the community, all in a single platform.
The platform’s community-driven approach is its key strength. Developers, industry experts, and technology contributors share their knowledge and tools on ProjectTwin as a pre-built module. This open collaboration effort makes digital twin technology more accessible, scalable, and cost-effective, allowing for innovative usage with digital twin. 
Problem Statement

The current application of digital twin technologies can only be seen in applications on the scale of complex and large industries such as car manufacturing factories, building HVAC systems, and construction sites. These applications on a large scale have seen extreme value and innovation brought on to the industry. Hence, a question was provoked by the author, “How can digital twin technology be brought to smaller to medium-sized enterprises?”. This question was not so often asked by the industry due to several reasons, mainly complexity and misconception of digital twin. 
Complexity of digital twin being perceived by SMEs are as follow, from the understanding of most SMEs, they understand that in an attempt to utilize the technology of digital twin, it will be an unmanageable technical complexity waiting ahead, just to list some: data integration, IoT, machine learning, software framework, specialised tool for 3D model. Ensuring all the technical are working together and providing value can only be seen as an overwhelming need of technical & domain expertise.
As for misconception, it is an illusion that has hindered several SMEs from even wanting to get their hands on the technology. The story of digital twins being largely used by large enterprises has instilled in SMEs that digital twins must consist of complex 3D models and simulations.

A crucial gap can be identified for SMEs to adopt digital twin: the lack of simplified digital twin tools tailored to their size and industry requirements. What SMEs need are solutions that simplify data integration, visualization, and analysis without requiring extensive customization. A good example could be a plug-and-play system that could help SMEs monitor critical assets or optimize logistics without the need to understand every technical detail. This also holds true for the secondary target user of ProjectTwin: indie developers, particularly those working on their side projects or exploring the realm of digital twins.
Therefore, this proposal will highlight these pain points in more depth and analyze how platforms like ProjectTwin can bridge these gaps.
1.	Complexity and Accessibility
One of the most significant barriers for SMEs is the perceived complexity of digital twin technology. A digital twin is often perceived to require advanced knowledge of IoT, machine learning, and 3D modelling, which are difficult to grasp for enterprises lacking technical expertise. SMEs struggle to integrate these technologies seamlessly, as many available tools demand a steep learning curve and considerable customization even with the help of enterprise-grade software. They need straightforward, accessible tools that offer value without requiring deep technical involvement. ProjectTwin aims to address this by providing pre-configured, easy-to-use solutions that allow SMEs to quickly deploy digital twins with minimal complexity.
2.	Cost and Resource Constraint
SMEs typically operate with limited financial and human resources, making the high cost of digital twin implementation a major obstacle. Unlike large enterprises, SMEs cannot easily justify the significant upfront investment required for IoT devices, software licenses, data storage, and skilled personnel. Additionally, the long-term maintenance costs—such as upgrading systems and ensuring continuous integration—create further financial pressure. With tight margins and restricted budgets, many SMEs find it difficult to allocate resources to such an investment, particularly when the return on investment (ROI) is not immediately clear.
3.	Time for Proof of Concept
Time constraints pose another significant issue for SMEs when considering digital twin technology. Developing a proof of concept (POC) can take months, involving intricate planning, configuration, and testing. For smaller businesses that need quick returns and fast operational improvements, the lengthy process required to implement and validate digital twins can seem impractical. SMEs often lack the luxury of time to experiment with complex technologies, especially when immediate results are critical to their survival and growth. The extended POC timeline delays the realization of benefits, deterring many from even attempting the initial implementation.




2.	Project Aim and Objectives
3.	
The aim of this project is to create a web-based platform for digital twin creation and management. The platform will welcome two types of users: 
-	DT user (SMEs/ indie developers that utilize the platform for digital twin solutions), and
-	Contributor (Developers, industry experts, and technology contributors, that contribute model, component, & use case to the platform).
The platform is said to be community-driven in the sense that all of the use case scenarios, models, and specialized visualization are contributed by the contributor. There will be 4 repositories that facilitate the core of ‘community-driven’, blueprint library, model registry, component registry, and layout registry. Blueprint Library is the embodiment of the ‘digital twin use case’, it is the abstraction for the other 3 repositories in a way that it will be the main interaction for the DT user, it is the main interface for the data integration from DT user data source to the element of the digital twin. Model Registry is the brain that allows the flexible use case of different ML and other models. Component Registry, the complex and flexible repository that gives power to the word ‘digital twin’ to be used by ProjectTwin instead of the ‘advanced data visualisation tool’; it is the repository that stores many kinds of modules ranging from, custom visualisation that initially ideated by the author to be a react app package as visualisation library, to external relevant tech tool such as rerun.io with their rerun viewer that can be package as a powerful visualisation to be used in ProjectTwin, and also can be an abstraction of an entity such as simulation of pedestrian as a plugin component to another module 3D digital world. Layout Registry, the easiest to understand among all 4, is the layout design of the dashboard element panel of the blueprint; though this won’t be that common for contributors to contribute, as the envisioned usage is 1 layout per blueprint, however, it can be useful for DT user to customise their digital twin dashboard by resizing, reposition, and hide certain element panel of the blueprint.

The objectives of this project are:
-	To develop a blueprint library where contributors can contribute digital twin use cases.
-	To create a custom blueprint JSON syntax standard and develop a parser for it.
-	To build a model registry where contributors can upload and share advanced ML models, with initial support for formats such as .h5, .keras, .pt, and .tf. The initial scope will focus on prediction ML models.
-	To establish a component registry where contributors can upload custom modules, including custom visualizations (e.g., custom map panel), integration with external tech tools (e.g., rerun.io viewer), 3D world simulations, and abstraction components (e.g., pedestrian simulation plugins for the 3D world).
-	To develop default visualization elements for the dashboard, such as line graphs, pie charts, videos, images, bar charts, etc.
-	To enable users to integrate their databases and stream data via Change Data Capture (CDC) into the elements of their digital twin models.
-	To create a layout registry that stores and manages the design layouts of panel elements used inside blueprints.
-	To develop at least three digital twin use cases that are highly relevant to the field of data science, which will serve as initial contributions to populate the community modules. 
-	To ensure the platform supports seamless integration with a wide range of data sources, initial scope is only SQL database (postgresql, mysql), future will include nosql and kafka
-	To explore the best practices for developing a standardized JSON blueprint format that is flexible enough to accommodate diverse digital twin use cases across different industries.
-	To evaluate various machine learning model formats and containerization methods to ensure compatibility, ease of deployment, and scalability across different environments (e.g., cloud, on-premise).
-	To implement collaborative features that allow users to share and work on digital twin projects with team members in real-time.
-	To establish a robust security framework, including user authentication, authorization, and data encryption, ensuring safe access to shared models and components.
-	To create monetization strategies that allow contributors to sell premium blueprints, models, and components while sharing revenue with the platform.
