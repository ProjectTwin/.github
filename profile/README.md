1.	Introduction
Assume the reader has very little knowledge of the subject. Introduce the topic, the sector of business/industry concerned and how the project relates to it. Define the context of the problem and identify the research required to solve it.

Digital twins (DT) have arrived in the modern world alongside other innovative technologies as the Industry Revolution 4.0. However, many have not heard of digital twins even in the digital world. Digital twins present itself with a vague definition that goes by a virtual replica of a physical objects, assets, entities, processes, or systems; DT exists to provide a dynamic data-driven representation of their real-world counterparts. 
The value of digital twins comes from the usage of the virtual entities, the usage from this digital counterpart can be extensive, only limited by creativity. But for a brief understanding of this usage, this proposal will categorize it into 5 categories: 
Monitor – monitor the real-world entities via the digital counterpart, examine the environment data, process data, geometry data, etc.
Prediction – predict the performance of the entity such as lifespan, maintenance requirement, production, energy input/output, etc.
Simulation – the powerful feature of DT, visualizing the entities at work; and when combine with prediction usage, allowing tuning of some variable of the DT and simulate the outcome of the DT, such as simulating a design concept, an HVAC system, a production factory, etc.
Diagnosis – diagnose/interrogate the entity by understanding all the elements that go through and happen in the twin, allowing diagnosis of entity such as identifying the bottleneck of a system, understanding the root cause of an accident, knowing the key performer, etc.
Optimization – optimize the real-world system by tuning through the digital world, and also with a proper combination of a few usages of other mentioned categories, the entity can be optimized such as the placement of elements in the system, optimal environment for the system, optimal route in a process, etc.
A digital twin is essentially a digital version of a real-world object, system, or process. For example, a factory's machinery, a city’s infrastructure, or even a human body can all have digital twins. These twins are not just static models; they continuously receive data from sensors and other sources to reflect the current state of their physical counterparts. This connection allows organizations to monitor the real-world entities, predict how they will perform in the future, run simulations to test different scenarios, diagnose problems, and optimize operations.
Project Twin is a community-driven platform designed to make the creation, management, and deployment of digital twins accessible to everyone, especially small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Traditionally, developing digital twins has been a complex and resource-intensive process, often requiring specialized technical expertise. ProjectTwin simplifies this by providing a pre-built digital twin use case that is contributed by the community, all in a single platform.
The platform’s community-driven approach is its key strength. Developers, industry experts, and technology contributors share their knowledge and tools on ProjectTwin as a pre-built module. This open collaboration effort makes digital twin technology more accessible, scalable, and cost-effective, allowing for innovative usage with digital twin. 
Problem Statement
Identify past and current work in the subject area. Outline the key references to other people’s work, indicate for the most pertinent of these how your proposal relates to the ideas they contain.

The current application of digital twin technologies can only be seen in applications on the scale of complex and large industries such as car manufacturing factories, building HVAC systems, and construction sites. These applications on a large scale have seen extreme value and innovation brought on to the industry. Hence, a question was provoked by the author, “How can digital twin technology be brought to smaller to medium-sized enterprises?”. This question was not so often asked by the industry due to several reasons, mainly complexity and misconception of digital twin. 
Complexity of digital twin being perceived by SMEs are as follow, from the understanding of most SMEs, they understand that in an attempt to utilize the technology of digital twin, it will be an unmanageable technical complexity waiting ahead, just to list some: data integration, IoT, machine learning, software framework, specialised tool for 3D model. Ensuring all the technical are working together and providing value can only be seen as an overwhelming need of technical & domain expertise.
As for misconception, it is an illusion that has hindered several SMEs from even wanting to get their hands on the technology. The story of digital twins being largely used by large enterprises has instilled in SMEs that digital twins must consist of complex 3D models and simulations.
However, there are still many attempts by big tech companies to tackle these issues for enterprises via software, such as Eclipse Ditto, Azure Digital Twin, AWS IoT Twinmaker, Epic Twinmotion, & Nvidia Omniverse. Therefore in this paper, we will dive into the analysis of these related works of software and in contrast to the research gap opportunity masterfully taken by ProjectTwin. 
Eclipse Ditto: an open-source framework focused on the connection and management of physical devices (IoT) with their digital counterparts, or digital twins. It emphasizes the ability to control and interact with IoT devices through RESTful APIs and messaging protocols. 
Azure Digital Twin: is a comprehensive cloud-based platform by Microsoft for creating digital representations of real-world entities and managing interactions between devices, people, and the environment. It is tightly integrated with Microsoft’s Azure IoT Hub and other Azure services.
AWS IoT TwinMaker: helps developers create digital twins of physical systems using AWS IoT, storage, analytics, and machine learning services. It focuses on accelerating the development of digital twins for industrial applications like smart factories and logistics.
Nvidia Omniverse: a platform for 3D design collaboration and simulation, aimed at industries like gaming, architecture, engineering, and manufacturing. It allows users to collaborate in real-time on 3D simulations, with high fidelity and integration of physics-based simulation tools.
Hence it can be recognized that there are some big names in the realm of digital twins, and they can also be said to be the figureheads for the spreading of digital twin technology. However, these big software had set their main customer to be the large enterprises, where those complex 3D modelling of a factory and other large-scale digital twins had surfaced. Although they are not restricted to SMEs, it is still open to the smaller enterprises to try on utilizing the advanced technology to their benefit.
However, this is where the loopholes are starting to emerge when SMEs attempt to integrate digital twin technologies. Despite the potential benefits, SMEs often face several challenges that large enterprises may not encounter as significantly.
When SMEs attempt to explore digital twin solutions, they are frequently overwhelmed by the need to balance the cost of investment with uncertain outcomes. Many SMEs do not have the technical infrastructure or budget to hire experts who can build and maintain complex systems. Moreover, many of the current digital twin solutions are highly customizable, which ironically works against SMEs, who generally seek pre-configured, easy-to-implement options that work "out of the box."
The user experience of SMEs trying to adopt digital twin solutions often includes confusion and frustration in setting up the environment and the necessary visualizations that provide actual value. Instead of quickly accessing actionable insights, they struggle with building meaningful dashboards or interfaces that accurately reflect their operations. This challenge is compounded by the need for advanced data analytics and 3D modelling—steps that can be overly complex for their limited resources. While platforms like AWS IoT TwinMaker and Azure Digital Twin offer potential, SMEs often find them too complicated, with steep learning curves.
Feedback from SMEs has also highlighted a crucial gap: the lack of simplified digital twin tools tailored to their size and industry requirements. What SMEs need are solutions that simplify data integration, visualization, and analysis without requiring extensive customization. A good example could be a plug-and-play system that could help SMEs monitor critical assets or optimize logistics without the need to understand every technical detail. This also holds true for the secondary target user of ProjectTwin: indie developers, particularly those working on their side projects or exploring the realm of digital twins.
Therefore, this proposal will highlight these pain points in more depth and analyze how platforms like ProjectTwin can bridge these gaps.
1.	Complexity and Accessibility
One of the most significant barriers for SMEs is the perceived complexity of digital twin technology. A digital twin is often perceived to require advanced knowledge of IoT, machine learning, and 3D modelling, which are difficult to grasp for enterprises lacking technical expertise. SMEs struggle to integrate these technologies seamlessly, as many available tools demand a steep learning curve and considerable customization even with the help of enterprise-grade software. They need straightforward, accessible tools that offer value without requiring deep technical involvement. ProjectTwin aims to address this by providing pre-configured, easy-to-use solutions that allow SMEs to quickly deploy digital twins with minimal complexity.
2.	Cost and Resource Constraint
SMEs typically operate with limited financial and human resources, making the high cost of digital twin implementation a major obstacle. Unlike large enterprises, SMEs cannot easily justify the significant upfront investment required for IoT devices, software licenses, data storage, and skilled personnel. Additionally, the long-term maintenance costs—such as upgrading systems and ensuring continuous integration—create further financial pressure. With tight margins and restricted budgets, many SMEs find it difficult to allocate resources to such an investment, particularly when the return on investment (ROI) is not immediately clear.
3.	Time for Proof of Concept
Time constraints pose another significant issue for SMEs when considering digital twin technology. Developing a proof of concept (POC) can take months, involving intricate planning, configuration, and testing. For smaller businesses that need quick returns and fast operational improvements, the lengthy process required to implement and validate digital twins can seem impractical. SMEs often lack the luxury of time to experiment with complex technologies, especially when immediate results are critical to their survival and growth. The extended POC timeline delays the realization of benefits, deterring many from even attempting the initial implementation.

The aim of this project is to create a web-based platform for digital twin creation and management. The platform will welcome two types of users: 
-	DT user (SMEs/ indie developers that utilize the platform for digital twin solutions), and
-	Contributor (Developers, industry experts, and technology contributors, that contribute model, component, & use case to the platform).
The platform is said to be community-driven in the sense that all of the use case scenarios, models, and specialized visualization are contributed by the contributor. There will be 4 repositories that facilitate the core of ‘community-driven’, blueprint library, model registry, component registry, and layout registry. Blueprint Library is the embodiment of the ‘digital twin use case’, it is the abstraction for the other 3 repositories in a way that it will be the main interaction for the DT user, it is the main interface for the data integration from DT user data source to the element of the digital twin. Model Registry is the brain that allows the flexible use case of different ML and other models. Component Registry, the complex and flexible repository that gives power to the word ‘digital twin’ to be used by ProjectTwin instead of the ‘advanced data visualisation tool’; it is the repository that stores many kinds of modules ranging from, custom visualisation that initially ideated by the author to be a react app package as visualisation library, to external relevant tech tool such as rerun.io with their rerun viewer that can be package as a powerful visualisation to be used in ProjectTwin, and also can be an abstraction of an entity such as simulation of pedestrian as a plugin component to another module 3D digital world. Layout Registry, the easiest to understand among all 4, is the layout design of the dashboard element panel of the blueprint; though this won’t be that common for contributors to contribute, as the envisioned usage is 1 layout per blueprint, however, it can be useful for DT user to customise their digital twin dashboard by resizing, reposition, and hide certain element panel of the blueprint.

The objectives of this project are:
-	Develop a blueprint library where contributors can contribute the digital twin use case to it
-	Develop a custom blueprint JSON syntax standard and parser
-	Develop a model registry where contributors can contribute advanced ML models and hold them in the registry, the candidate formats for storing the ML model are (.h5, .keras, .pt, .tf). Initial development scope may only consist of the prediction ML model
-	Develop a component registry where contributors can contribute custom module into it, the initial example usage of component registry consist of custom visualization (eg. custom map panel), external tech tool usage (eg. rerun.io viewer for camera breakdown), 3D world (init an empty 3D world), & abstraction component (eg. pedestrian simulation plugin to 3D world)
-	Develop a default visualization element for the dashboard such as line graph, pie chart, video, image, bar chart, etc.
-	Allow DT user to integrate their database and stream data via CDC into the element for digital twin
-	Develop a layout registry that stores the design layout of the panel element inside the blueprint 
-	Develop 3 digital twin use cases that is heavily relevant to the field of data science to initiate the population of the community module.
