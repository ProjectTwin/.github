ProjectTwin

Hi, if you found this organisation, probably by getting seo of this readme description
I hope that we can connect and share our vision for project of similar like this

I am writing this description as broad because I am having trouble looking for collaborator 
and like minded person

so the project which simply call ProjectTwin is a community driven digital twin creation and managemnt platform
 to out it simply what it trying to solve is that the sharing of digital tein technology and not only dogital twin, it can also be the
 technology of many machine learning model or artificial intelligence model / AI model, i know the issue of example like people create a 
 very good use case of data or technology such as sharing machine learning model, so this is a platform for sharing machine learning model

 Users can easily select, customize, and 
deploy digital twins, integrating various data sources 
and leveraging pre-configured models, components, 
and visualizations for enhanced functionality. The 
platform supports 2D/3D models, textual 
representations, data dashboards, and AR/VR models,

you may think the info a bit doesnt make sense, and it is because 
I am writing this README for seo reach to potential collaborator
